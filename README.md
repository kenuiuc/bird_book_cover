# [GPT-5 mini Prompt] Bird Gallary Project
- Id like to make a webpage that show all the pictures and the book titles scraped from [oreilly media website](https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?x-o=20&x-search=bird&x-sort=newest)
- They have 25 pages with these URLs and I need to re-organize all the contents in a single page:
```
https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?&x-search=bird&x-sort=newest
https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?x-o=20&x-search=bird&x-sort=newest
https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?x-o=40&x-search=bird&x-sort=newest
https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?x-o=60&x-search=bird&x-sort=newest
...
https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?x-o=480&x-search=bird&x-sort=newest
```
- You should display the pictures in my webpage but just embed their URLs and no need to download any pictures
- Ideally your source code is just a single markdown file
